        Lights Out is a game that utilizes a 5x5 grid of "lights" where the player must toggle all lights off in order
        to win. While this may sound easy enough, when a light is switched, the four adjacent lights are switched as well.
        Below is an example with a click in the middle square: <div class="goodluck">Good luck!</div>
        <div class="example">

            <img src="after-click.png">

        &emsp; To begin this final project, I had to do a lot of research and learn some new concepts. While I have experience in Java,
        I do not have experience in JavaScript so I had to figure out how to transfer my thought-up solution from Java to
        JavaScript. This proved to be much more difficult than I thought. After a lot of trial and error my program finally
        began to work, and I was able to get it to where it is now. <br> &emsp; That being said, one major sacrifice that I had to make
        through trial and error was an external JavaScript file. So, I had to nest the JavaScript inside of script tags at the
        end of the body. Outside of that, my code largely worked out how I thought it would. Most of my code lies in functions
        and only two variable declarations and a function call lie outside. This function sets up 90% of the game; calling the
        intialize grid function, which builds the grid and creates the event listeners tied to the squares on the grid. The
        listener that is added listens for clicks on a square and then runs the toggleLight function with the event. The
        toggleLight function then updates the grid with the newly toggled lights by calling the toggle function, calls the
        update board function, and calls the win function to check for a win.
        <br> &emsp; For the style I opted for a simplistic look similar to my last project's look. With simple colors like the ones that
        I chose I think that the black outline+shadow combo looks really nice. I also changed the font as well in order to better fit the feel
        of the site.
