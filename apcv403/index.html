                    This was the first lab where we created a site page and uploaded it to a URL. For the contents of the site, we had to
                    convert an essay to HTML. I used one of my own research papers from ENGV306 Advanced Composition.

                    In this lab, we began to learn CSS and how to use it to beautify our Lab 2 essay. The external CSS file can be viewed at
                    this URL + "/lab-4/styles.css".

                    This was the first lab where we utilized JavaScript, and we did so to solve a problem that we came up with. The program
                    that I decided to create was a word, character, and space counter. So, given a text, the program would ouput that data
                    to you. In this project, we also had to create a "Holy Grail" layout using CSS and Grid/Flexbox. This "Holy Grail"
                    layout needed a title, a NAV bar, content, an ad, and a footer.

                    In the final lab, we had to create a version of the game "Lights Out" using JavaScript. In addition to this, we had the option
                    to add some beautifucation to it. Finally, we also had to figure out a way to create a random game. I accompished this
                    by simuation 10 random clicks on the game at the push of the button.
