    <p> When a client accesses a website, the font is chosen based on the information given in the pages html file.
    This is fairly straightforward, for the most part. There are many different, common fonts that are used across the web
    that are often already downloaded on the user's PC. There are some cases, however, where a website uses a custom font
    outside of the ones that are usually used. In this case, the web programmer simply needs to provide the location of the
    font file to the html file. By doing this, the users will be able to download the custom font upon visiting the site.</p>
