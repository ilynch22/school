                        The problem that I set out to solve using javascript was to create a tool that could count the characters, words, and
                        spaces of a pasted text. To accomplish this, I had to read in a string from an input box, create a button to actually
                        count the string, and then process the string post-button-pressing. This first piece was relatively simple. For this I
                        utilized the input class provided by HTML. Directly following this was where I ran into issues, however. I ran into a
                        problem where my javascript file was seemingly going undetected by my VS code Live Server. The problem turned out to be
                        caused by the location of my javascript file, even though it was directly adjacent to my html file in explorer.
                        To solve this, I created two new folders within my site folder for both my javascript and css files. Following this bug,
                        creating my site was fairly smooth sailing. This was my first time using javascript so it took my some time to learn
                        syntax, but that was my main hurdle for the rest of the project.
